**DO NOT DO THIS ON A REAL MACHINE** Do not manually remove ``jail`` folder! Use only the scripts provided.
  
You are playing "Bad Software Monopoly" and you just drew the "Go to jail!" card. Fortunately, you chose to play with the **root** token.

Find your "Get out of jail free" card and get your well deserved reward.

Access the ``monopoly/`` subfolder.

Run: ``sudo ./go_to_jail`` and try to escape the ``chroot`` jail. When you escape, read the ``/flag`` file.

Run ``sudo ./destroy_jail`` to remove the jail
