Your goal is to exploit the ``vuln`` executable to call the functions ``warcraft()``, ``diablo()`` and then ``starcraft()`` (one at a time). For this, identify the buffer overflow, craft the proper payloads and feed them to the standard input for the executable.

   Use ``nm`` to determine function addresses.

   Use ``python -c 'print 100 * "A" + "\xab\xcd\xef\x01"' | ./vuln`` to feed input to the ``vuln`` executable.
