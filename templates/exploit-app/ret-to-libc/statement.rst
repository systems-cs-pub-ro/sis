Your goal is to create shells by calling ``system()``. Do this in three different ways:

   a. Call ``system("/bin/bash")`` from function ``enroth()``.

   b. Comment out ``enroth()`` and call ``system("sh")`` using the call to ``system()`` in function ``erathia()`` and the ``sh`` string already in the executable.

   c. Also comment out ``erathia()`` and call ``system("sh")`` by using the address of ``system()`` in the standard C library. Disable ASLR by using ``echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space``.
